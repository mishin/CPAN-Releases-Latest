Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Releases::Latest

0.03 2014-04-15
    - I was using '//' but only requiring perl 5.006. Switched it to '||',
      as I could safely use it in that situation. Thanks again CPAN Testers.

0.02 2014-04-14
    - Split _build_cached_index() into two separate private methods,
      one for getting the info from MetaCPAN, and the other for building
      the cached index.
    - Added a live test, t/03-live-test.t
    - Added description of max_age parameter to new()
    - Added a SEE ALSO section to the doc
